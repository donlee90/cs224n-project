isbn : 1492913731 isbn-13 : 978-1492913733 for my family , who encouraged me to never stop fighting for my dreams chapter 1 summer vacations supposed to be fun , right ?
i wish i had a better answer to that question .
starlings , new york is not the place youd expect much to happen .
its a small quiet town , the kind where everyone knows your name .
its a place where your parents wouldnt even care if you stayed out late biking with your friends .
only because everyone felt so safe , so comfy .
they dont know the half of it .
but i do .
i know it all and starlings is not the place where you want to be after dark .
the only reason why no one knows this is because jason , emily , seth and i have kept it that way .
i walked along the empty road alone , occasionally waving to passing kids on bikes .
my backpack was slung over my shoulder , filled with my writing books and sketchpads .
i kept my eyes on the shadowed road , watching my every step .
usually i was more aware of my surroundings , but today i was tired and didnt care if i rammed into a tree .
i kicked a rock into the grass .
the sun was starting to set , painting the sky in brilliant oranges and reds .
it slipped down the sky , allowing the first stars to peek out from behind the bright curtain .
the remaining light cast shadows over everything , creating the illusion that there was double of everything .
the world prepared to go into its hours of unreal silence that made it seem magical , and it really was .
my phone buzzed and i awoke from my trance .
i thumbed the keypad and opened the message seth had sent me .
it read : whatcha doing ?
i flipped open the pad and wrote : walking home .
i shoved it back in my pocket and continued walking .
the sun was almost gone and shadows were starting to appear behind everything .
i looked at my own shadow , that danced behind me .
the phone buzzed again as seth sent me a reply .
see anything ?
do you want me to meet you ?
i glanced at the nearby woods .
my ears heard nothing and i didnt see any movement but my hands shook slightly as i typed , nothing , im fine .
i didnt open his reply because i knew what it would say .
i already knew that it was strangely quiet .
maybe i could stay home and sleep one night .
or maybe i could finish a painting tonight and watch mom do origami .
i turned the corner , and my house came into view .
i started to climb the hill when i froze .
out of my left eye i saw the outline of a creature .
it was heading through the woods in the direction of my house .
i swore under my breath and took off for the woods .
my feet crunched on the fallen branches and leaves .
i could see the creature ahead of me .
i didnt have much time .
i placed my bag on the ground and crossed my legs .
i started to grab my phone but stopped .
i didnt need to tell the others , it was just one .
and if i was lucky , it would be an easy take down .
i closed my eyes and began my mental countdown .
the wind picked up around me , as if a wind current had just appeared out of nowhere .
5 my body started to feel hot , like i was being hugged by the sun .
i hated this part .
4 power surged through me as i was freed from my human self .
shivers ran down my spine .
3 i felt cold , like being dipped in ice water .
the breeze picked up even harder .
2 i was hollow and could probably see my own body if i opened my eyes .
but i could never get the courage to do that .
1 the wind died .
my body felt normal except it was different .
i opened my eyes and looked over to where i just had been or still was .
my human body slightly glowed as it sat in meditation under the tree .
it didnt move .
i could see the monster clearly now that i had stepped into its world .
it was hunched over , occasionally touching the ground with one of its curled front paws .
dark saliva dripped out of its mouth .
the beady black eyes made it no less scary .
i knew exactly what it is .
a thrasher !
a shiver ran down my spine .
thrashers were probably one of the most feral and nasty monsters ive ever encountered .
they sometimes travel alone or hunt in packs .
theyre awful in packs , extremely hard to take out without their knowledge of your presence .
i placed an arrow in my bow , and aimed for the head .
i couldnt let the creature reach my house .
i pulled back the string , and then stopped .
i couldnt take out one of these like , this unless i set it on fire .
but emily wasnt here .
i could take it out with a few arrows but its best to kill thrashers before they realize youre there .
instead i lowered my bow and slowly crept up to it , until i could see the hideous claws on its hands and the hatred in its eyes .
thrashers hate everything and sometimes i wonder how they tolerate each other .
i aimed for the head again and released the arrow .
it whizzed silently into the thrasher and it howled in pain as the arrow dug into its fur .
it whirled around , facing me .
a low growl sounded in its throat and it charged .
i ducked as it slashed my side and i winced .
my shirt slowly turned blue from the trickling wound .
yes , blue , my blood is blue .
it turned back around and threw its self at me .
this time i was prepared .
i pulled out my hunting knife out just as he landed on me .
he yelped and went limp .
i pushed him off and grabbed my fallen bow , the familiar feeling of the wood boosting my confidence .
i turned back around and started back where i left off , but then a body slammed into me .
i just had enough time to see the thrasher , before the fur and dirt filled my vision .
i spit out the clump of wiry hair that had somehow found its way into my gasping mouth .
i felt a searing pain as the thrasher raked my left leg .
i closed my eyes against the pain , trying to focus myself against the dull throb in my shin .
then the thrasher went limp against me .
it was hauled off of my body and i found myself looking up into the face of a very unhappy dark blue haired boy .
his sword was gripped tightly in his clenched fingers and a look of amusement , or many it was anger , shone on his face .
i swallowed and collected my weapons from the ground , not daring to look at my leg .
hi seth , this is unexpected .
seth glared at me and pulled me up .
he was definitely angry at me .
i tried to place weight on my leg but winced as pain shot up it .
he kicked the dead thrasher one more time before sheathing his sword .
you know better jazell then to take on a monster by yourself .
you never know what kind it is until you have already changed , he scolded me and i could feel a lecture coming .
i looked down at leg .
claw marks ran up my shin and my blue blood was soaking my pants .
i had to seth ; it was heading for my house .
that made me panic a bit .
i dont care jazell ; if i hadnt been here i would have found you shredded to small pieces .
all you had to do was send me a quick text and i would have showed up to help .
but you didnt .
i sighed in annoyance , not in the mood for this right now .
seth was like this sometimes , strict and serious , but he was normally a jokester .
hes strict on the fact that we attack in groups , mostly for the reason that he didnt want anything to happen to our group .
i started to slowly limp back to my body but seth just disappeared from my side .
he has this annoying skill to be able to just return to his body without having to be near it , which wasnt fair when he wasnt the one injured .
i , however , had to stiffly make my way to my dormant human body .
once i was near it , i closed my eyes and the wind picked back up .
my body felt hot and cold simultaneously as i returned .
i reopened my eyes and stood up , stretched , and grabbed my bag .
my back sent a chorus of cracks cascading upwards as i straightened myself .
i raised the side of my shirt to find the thin , red scratch marks .
any injuries i get in my hunter form i have when i become human again , just not as severe .
i quickly ran my fingers over the darker , thicker marks on my shin , the skin sore and purple .
i quickly checked myself for any other injures i might have acquired from my tangle with the thrasher , but all i found was a bunch of bruises .
seth seemed to have disappeared , so i trudged down the road to my house .
its cozy familiar blue paint and white shutters helped to relax me as i pushed open the door .
my house wasnt very big and fancy ; it was actually pretty plain but thats why i loved it .
it had two floors , with a fair sized kitchen and a mini living room .
my room was just up the stairs , and it beckoned to me even though i was more interested in dinner .
my mom was cooking in the kitchen and my dad was sitting at the kitchen table going through his usual paper work .
he looked up as i entered , pushing his glasses back up his face .
hi sweetheart , finally home ?
he asked giving me a warm smile .
i kissed his cheek and my moms before heading toward the stairs .
yup .
dinners ready in a few minutes , jazell !
my mom called as i climbed the stairs , eager to collapse on my bed for a few minutes .
got it !
i called back .
my room was painted a light green , with a bed shoved in the corner and a bookshelf overflowing with books .
i had a small desk to the left of my bed that was piled up high with homework and random drawings .
i threw my bag on my bed and took off my shoes .
then i headed back down stairs to help set the table .
my mom handed me some dishes and utensils .
i set a plate down in front of my dad .
he frowned and pointed to my scratched shin .
what happened ?
he asked , and studied my leg .
i tripped on a crack and scraped my leg .
i said flatly , the lie rolling off my tongue easily .
i placed my last dish down and sat in my chair .
dad chuckled .
youre so clumsy .
i wouldnt be surprised if you tripped on your own feet .
yup , thats me , clumsy .
i pulled my leg close to my body .
my parents had believed for a long time that i was a klutz .
that was the only way to explain the million of cuts and bruises i gained from fighting creatures .
the truth is that i have really great balance , which i had gained from so much fighting .
i was a little klutzy when i was small , so it was easy for my parents to believe i still was .
mom placed the food on the table .
dinner !
after dinner i went straight up stairs to go to sleep .
and hopefully my phone wouldnt stop me like it did most nights .
monsters loved to come out at night and cause trouble .
they never seem to rest , much to my annoyance .
i sighed and rolled over , burying my face in my pillow .
i managed to think about something other than creatures that go bump in the night as i drifted off to sleep .
in the morning i changed and ran down stairs and left a note saying i was going out to eat with jason , emily and seth .
it took me minutes to speed down to the small breakfast restaurant in town .
i chained up my bike and walked over to the plastic blue table my friends had occupied .
i slid in next to emily , who was talking about some book she had read recently .
jason , who sat next to her , was pretending to be fascinated by her rant .
emily stopped in mid-sentence when she noticed me sitting beside her .
jazell , youre here !
she exclaimed .
is it true , did you take on a monster by yourself yesterday ?
i sighed , shooting a look at seth .
yes it is .
thanks tattle-tale seth .
well you did and i thought the group had a right to know that .
seth said sharply .
how could you jazell ?
you could have gotten seriously hurt .
plus i bet all of us want a shot at them too .
she huffed and shook her head .
the light brown curls that framed her pretty face bounced around playfully .
im fine emily , seriously .
jason was silent .
he never talked much like emily , who was easily the most talkative , friendly person i knew .
jason was more of the silent , watching type , who said little but noticed much .
i traced in a puddle on the table , avoiding everyones eye contact as they stared at me .
emily patted my arm .
its okay .
we arent mad at you or anything .
right seth ?
she glared at him .
he shrugged .
i guess .
emily perked up .
you see , everyone makes mistakes .
seth grunted to himself .
emily rolled her eyes .
hey seth , its not like you havent done something stupid .
we all remember the swamp troll .
seth frowned and jason snickered .
seth punched his arm .
hey dont make me nag you about the time you almost took off my head with your throwing knifes .
jason stopped dead and narrowed his eyes .
it was an accident .
i didnt know youd run that way .
alright , we understand that weve all done stupid , foolish things .
so lets just add this accident to my list , okay ?
i said quickly before the two started something .
they nodded but shot each other smirks .
i sighed , wondering why those two buffoons had been granted this power along , with emily and me .
its not like they werent foolish enough already .
the day when it all changed was still a mystery to us .
a lot of things happened that didnt quite make sense .
the four of us were already best friends .
we were walking through the woods , rambling on about how halloween was almost here and that ms. stecher was still giving us too much homework .
then all of a sudden an invisible object slammed into me .
i shrieked and couldnt move .
it had me pinned to the ground .
seth ran forward and grabbed a branch to protect me .
it should have gone right through the air but it collided into something and snapped in half .
seth dropped it in amazement .
emily ran over to me but was plowed to the ground .
she screamed , spitting out dirt , twigs and leaves .
seth stood watching , terrified .
he didnt have a clue as what to do to fight these invisible creatures .
none of us did , at that time , because we didnt know what was going on .
the world was still a normal place to us at the time .
something grabbed seths legs and pulled him against a tree .
he kicked and punched but couldnt find the right place to hit his attacker .
hold on !
jason yelled .
i opened my mouth to say that we already were when he vanished .
dragged away was my guess .
my legs shot with pain .
i heard emily yell the first curse words ive heard her say in a while .
i spotted her red arm just before my body felt like fire .
i closed my eyes and blacked out .
i didnt really black out but thats what i thought at the time .
i opened my eyes to find i was sitting on the ground next to my sleeping body .
i saw emily sitting there , saying nothing for once .
something fell off my back and i picked it up .
it was a wooden bow , and when i reached behind my back i felt a quiver full of feathered arrows strapped there .
i ran a finger over the smooth , dark wood and turned to see seth crashing out of the woods .
i smirked at him and pointed at his head .
you have dark blue hair .
i giggled , not knowing why i was giggling after what had just happened to us a few minutes ago .
he frowned and pulled a piece or two out of his head .
his eyes widened , and i laughed at the shock on his face .
if we were dead , which was my best guess , why not poke fun at him ?
seth smiled at me .
well , yes but you have green hair .
its bright green , like neon green .
i shoved my hair in front of my face .
it was bright green all right .
i stood up and examined myself .
i was wearing light brown hunting boots and tight black pants made out of some sort of light cloth .
a thick woven jacket was shielding me from the october cold .
when i looked back at seth , i realized he had also made an outfit change .
he was wearing black leather boots and dark blue pants .
his top was a short , brown cloak with a hood and leather belt .
a beautiful steel sword with an ornamental hilt was swinging at his side from a woven sheath .
oh well , i guess i have green hair .
its not that bad .
i like green .
i rambled as i examined the short hunting knife that was resting in a small sheath on my hip .
i ran a finger over the blade before putting it back .
how seth and i had acquired such dangerous weapons was anyones guess .
i certainly had no clue .
i heard footsteps and turned to see emily running over .
she was wearing a close fitting , long robe .
it was a stunning deep blue with a trim of gold embroidery .
she had no weapons dangling from her body were visible from where i was standing .
i have pink hair !
isnt it cool ?
she spun around so we could take in all of its bubblegum pink color .
she looked at the bow slung over my shoulder and seths gleaming sword .
hey , i dont have anything cool and deadly .
why do you both get something like that and i didnt ?
its not like you can trust jazell with something sharp or dangerous .
hey !
we cant trust you either .
i pointed out , crossing my arms .
arming you is as scary as giving a kindergartener a knife .
she gasped .
yeah , well , im ignoring you now .
she huffed and turned around .
there you are !
jason exclaimed as he crashed out of the trees , panting .
his wavy hair was a deep red that framed his eyes but he didnt seem to have noticed its color change or to care .
he was wearing an all black layered tunic and pants with boots that looked as light as mine .
if i didnt know it was jason , i would have taken a huge step backwards at his assassin-like appearance .
whats going on ?
he demanded , eyes flickering from each of us as he took in all of our strange appearances .
dont know jason , were as stumped as you .
i said .
he bit his lip and then smirked .
oh , i almost forgot .
look at this .
he gestured at his belt , grinning mischievously .
hanging there were a multitude of thin , dangerous looking knives .
he pulled up his sleeve so i could see another one strapped there .
cool , huh ?
emily had turned to see jason appear .
she spotted his knives and groaned , stomping her foot .
aw come on !
jason whispered behind his hand to seth and i. whats up with her ?
seth shrugged .
i dont know .
girl issues ?
i heard that !
emily said angrily .
thats when suddenly a hideous creature appeared in front of us .
it was hunched over , with thick furry skin and wicked claws that shot out of its curled paws .
we would soon know them as thrashers , beasts we would get used to seeing .
i dont know who screeched louder in fear , but im pretty sure it might have been me .
seth pulled his sword out but his hand shook like mad .
i clumsily pulled an arrow out of the quiver on my back and struggled to attach it to my bow .
how the heck did those people in movies make this look so easy ?
i exchanged a look with seth , but he looked as clueless as i did .
none of this felt real .
i swear , the creature laughed at us .
or maybe my fear was making me see and hear things .
jason moved silently to stand beside us , one of his throwing knives in his hand .
what do we do ?
were dead so it cant hurt us right ?
i asked .
i dont feel dead .
jason whispered .
i didnt either .
in fact , i realized that my whole body was aching from the strange attack i had experienced .
and if i was dead , i wouldnt need to breathe so heavily .
my heart was racing so fast that it might explode right out of my chest .
jason threw the knife he had been holding and it stuck into a tree .
he grinned at me and i guess it hit exactly where he wanted .
on the count of three , we attack with everything weve got .
okay ?
seth looked at jason and i .
we nodded at him .
one , two three !
when seth hit three , he charged with his sword .
i pulled back and released my arrow .
it hit the thrashers front paw .
before i could think , i had notched another one on the bow and drew back the string .
it was like i had been an archer my whole life .
jason threw knife after knife , hitting its mark every time .
when the creature went down , seth stood and took a breath .
then another tackled him to the ground .
i didnt know what to do and jason didnt either .
emily ran forward and pointed to seth who was clawing toward his weapon .
do something !
she screamed .
before i could reply , fire shot from her finger .
the thrasher yelped and jumped off seth and ran toward emily .
she smiled wickedly and held both hands out , pelting the creature with fire .
i pulled seth up in time to see the thrasher buried entangled by roots shooting from the dirt .
jason threw a knife in the pile to make sure it was really dead .
you okay ?
i asked seth , and congratulated emily on her new found talent .
im fine .
he said and limped over .
i gasped and pointed to his leg .
seth , youre bleeding blue !
he just blinked at him , glancing down at his leg .
he didnt answer as he tugged at me to start walking back towards where we had last seen ourselves .
we could still see our bodies sleeping peacefully , but this time i noticed that we were all faintly glowing blue .
i could see the rise and fall of my chest as i breathed .
so i really was alive , which made this situation even creepier and stranger .
i had two bodies !
how was this even possible ?
what do we do ?
seth , do you any ideas ?
she frowned when he didnt answer .
seth ?
emily spun in a circle but seth was nowhere to be found .
seth walked out from behind a tree .
but he was normal seth .
he had his dirty blonde hair back and was wearing his dirty jeans and shirt from school .
no dark red hair , no glimmering sword , no bleeding wound .
his warrior self was nowhere to be seen .
seth howd you do that ?
i asked .
he whirled around .
whos there ?
me , you idiot !
i snorted .
he stared at the place where i was standing , but his eyes werent focused on me .
jazell ?
obviously , are you blind ?
i can hear you but cant see you .
arent you back ?
where are you ?
no .
i said frustrated , now tell us how you got back .
he closed his eyes and sat down .
i imagined myself in my body , and what is was like to be back .
and then i was back to normal .
wait .
the wind picked up around him and then suddenly he was back , blue hair and all , standing beside his sitting , normal body .
wow how did you do that ?
emily gasped .
i imagined what it was like to fight that creature .
and then my body took over .
he explained , but i dont think he even understood .
then he was gone again and the real seth stood up .
try it .
i closed my eyes and thought of school and all of ms. stechers homework that i needed to do .
then my body was doing the rest .
i felt hot and cold , as the winds seemed to pick up .
i shivered and opened my eyes .
i was lying on the ground .
my hair brown hair flopped in my face as i sat up , seeing emily dash over to me .
seconds later jason walked through the trees , rubbing his face .
seth grinned at all of us ; we were back .
thats how it all started .
i dont know how we got the gift to become these different people , but we did .
thats the mystery and hopefully well solve it one day .
we were chosen for some unknown reason , but that reason doesnt matter .
all that matters is that we protect this town .
jasons eyes flashed .
i stood up and leaned over to him .
what jason ?
monsters , a whole bunch of them .
i saw the movement near the pond .
he pointed to the pond that was just nestled in the woods .
and with that , we were off .
running towards the pond to do what we do best , destroy monsters .
only this time it was different .
chapter 2 we ran and ducked behind a large boulder , huddling together .
we all sat down , closed our eyes , and concentrated .
i felt a shiver run through my body as i left it and entered my hunter form .
i followed emily , jason , and seth as we crept silently over to the monsters , splitting up to surround them .
i counted two thrashers , which surprised me .
i swear we saw more before .
the thrasher turned before we could execute a surprise attack .
seth marched over , swinging his sword .
jason threw knives calmly at the other monster while emily casted fire by his side .
i , however , was jumped on by something entirely new .
they were small and stubby , the size of dwarfs or gnomes .
their skin was shriveled and grey , and hung off their bodies like cold clothing .
their eyes were a bright yellow that matching their teeth and their fingers looked like gnarly old trees .
and the smell ; it was awful .
they grabbed my feet , back and tugged at my hair .
why does everything always happen to me ?
i complained .
no one heard me .
the ugly creatures continued tugging at me like annoying two year old , which made me get really annoyed .
get off me ugly looking toad dwarfs .
hey , thats what ill call you , toad dwarfs .
i smiled at my quick thinking .
i could be clever sometimes .
take that seth .
silly girl , were already called toad dwarfs .
the one on my leg croaked .
aw darn , never mind then .
so much for being clever .
the one on my back grabbed my hair .
he yanked it back .
ow !
it may be green but i still value it !
i grumbled , trying to pull my head free .
i also had no desire to be bald at 16 .
hes rising , hes rising !
the dwarf said excitedly .
his voice cracked at the last word .
who the heck is rising and why does it require pulling my hair out !
i snapped .
hes rising , hes rising !
he repeated , full of crazed excitement .
i swear i could feel him shaking from exhilaration .
whatever , youre now an official maniac .
i pulled out my hunting knife .
maniacs get destroyed by me .
no maniacs are allowed to exist except for me and emily .
he jumped off as i stabbed the one on my arm .
i grabbed my bow and shot him with an arrow before he his little legs could he him very far .
he fell to the ground , the arrow sticking straight up at the sky .
now the forest was maniac free .
i killed the others and looked up to find the thrashers dead too , probably courtesy of seth .
a few dwarfs were also lying dead in front of emily .
i walked back to my body and closed my eyes .
when i reopened them , i stood , stretching my legs .
the four of us headed back to the restaurant together , adrenaline still pumping through my veins .
i told emily and the boys about the freaky dwarves .
crazy right ?
i asked , running a hand through my hair .
no one said anything and emily produced a pencil out of her bag .
i need a piece of paper , jazell .
i ripped one out of my notebook and handed it to her .
we sat at the table and emily titled the page : warnings .
i didnt know why .
okay , jazell , what exactly did he say ?
emily asked , pencil poised in the air ready to write .
he said , hes rising , hes rising .
i have no idea who he meant or if what he said means anything .
emily scribbled down , toad dwarf said , hes rising , hes rising .
whos coming and is he important ?
i stared at the paper , the question swirling in my mind .
who did he mean ?
now what did the dwarf tell you , seth ?
she asked .
he said , you wont stop him , little warrior .
he frowned at the last part .
emily added , toad dwarf told seth , you wont stop him , little warrior .
does this mean hes powerful ?
did you have to add the little warrior part ?
it makes me sound weak .
seth complained .
i did because we need all the facts .
its obvious the dwarf was trying to make you sound weak anyway .
now what did he tell you , jason ?
he said , he will destroy all half-lings .
whats that supposed to mean , anyway ?
jason said .
she added the last bullet ; toad dwarf said to jason , he will destroy all half-ling .
what does half-ling mean ?
did the dwarfs tell you anything ?
i asked , taking the paper .
none of what she wrote on the paper made any sense to me .
she shook her head .
no and if they did , i was too busy trying to burn them to hear them .
she took the paper back .
well i think the only thing weve established is that toad dwarves are crazy .
seth said .
i noticed a thin , red line on his cheek where a thrasher must have scratched him .
emily wagged her finger at him .
never dis facts .
they might save you later in life .
seth just snorted .
jason punched him in the side .
listen to emily .
shes actually right sometimes .
thank you , jason .
she said cheerfully , huh wait , sometimes ?
she raised an eyebrow at him .
jason scowled at her .
im admitting youre sometimes right so dont push it .
point taken .
she tucked the paper in her drawstring bag .
you guys want to go to the park ?
they both half nodded , half shrugged , which she took for a yes .
so we got up and mounted our bikes .
i threw the bike lock in my bag , clipped on my helmet , and followed the others .
the three of them raced each other , but i kept my bike behind them .
what the dwarf had said was still troubling me and i didnt know if anyone else was feeling the same way .
i saw seth slow his bike down and glide next to me .
hey , he said .
hey .
then a question popped into my head , what were you doing alone in the woods yesterday ?
he was silent so i yelled to emily , hey , seths lost for words !
emily appeared by me and chuckled .
whats wrong , seth ?
thrasher got your tongue ?
before he could reply i said , i asked him what he was doing in the woods yesterday and he didnt have an answer .
we all know what this means .
yup , hes hiding something .
seth , why were you yelling at jazell for being out alone in the woods when you were doing the same ?
i wasnt hunting down monsters alone .
jazell was doing that , he grumbled , clearly annoyed .
but you were still out alone and you yelled at me for doing the same thing .
the same thing could have happened to you .
do you think youre stronger than the rest of us ?
my voice rose slightly at the end of my question .
no .
he went quiet and tried to avoid our eye contact .
now whos keeping secrets ?
youre breaking your own rules .
why were you out ?
emily can be very demanding sometimes , i actually felt a little bad about involving her in my interrogation .
just a little .
he mumbled something under his breath .
i cant hear you .
emily snapped .
i was out scouting !
he shouted , now can you hear me ?
yes , and now youve made me deaf !
emily yelled back .
why were you out scouting in the first place ?
i asked calmly , trying not to shout it out like emily .
seth gripped the handlebars and i knew he was losing his temper .
i was being cautious so we didnt have to worry last night , he said through gritted teeth .
he was lying and both of us knew that .
i glared at him , nice story seth , now what really happened ?
he didnt say anything and he rode ahead to get beside jason , who was in the lead .
the park slowly came in view .
it was a huge grass circle with a small play set in the middle covered in kids .
the woods surrounded it except for the side that faced the street .
a fountain was near the entrance along with a bike rack .
thats where we parked our bikes .
i clicked the lock together and grabbed my bag .
emily was fumbling with her bike lock , which was old and rusted and usually refused to work without a fight .
i walked over and tried to help her .
why do you think seth wont tell us what he was doing ?
i asked , watching her because she had refused to let me help .
pride purposes ?
he was yelling at you when he broke his own rules .
he just doesnt want to admit he did she said through her wild hair .
her lock finally clicked and she stood up .
the boys were walking side by side towards the play set .
it wasnt actually that small but it looked that way from the street .
there were six swings and a tower with four slides attached to it .
i ran after them with emily right behind me .
i slowed down next to jason and put my arm on his shoulder .
hey jason , do you know seths a liar ?
i asked and seth shot me a bad look .
jason frowned at me , what are you talking about , jazell ?
he broke his own rules .
he was out scouting without telling us .
i smiled and jason stiffened .
what ?
he growled .
are you two trying to create trouble ?
seth cut in .
emily put her arm around my shoulders .
no , we just want the truth , emily said sweetly .
yeah okay , whatever .
seth shoved his hands in his pockets , and glared at the ground .
i sat on one of the swings next to emily .
i traced the sticky metal rings and sighed .
emily was on her phone .
i saw seth and jason arguing off to the side .
everything was back to normal .
there was even a dwarf climbing the slide .
wait , hold on .
a dwarf ?
i elbowed emily in the arm , uh emily , is a dwarf using a slide a normal thing ?
i nodded in the direction of the dwarf and her eyes widened in surprise .
she jumped off the swing and grabbed me by the arm .
she ran over to jason and gripped his arm with her free hand , pulling us both after her .
seth frowned but had no choice but to follow .
wheres the dwarf ?
she asked quickly .
climbing the slide .
weird huh ?
i almost tripped but i caught myself .
she pushed us into the woods , we got to move fast before someone gets hurt .
make sure no one is around .
in a matter of seconds , i had an arrow in my bow , seth had his sword in his hand and jason had his hands full of knives .
the dwarf was sitting on the edge of the slide , looking like an ugly version of a toddler , and a few more came out of the woods to join him .
we tried to sneak up without being spotted but one of the dwarves turned his head and saw us .
he immediately launched himself onto emily .
she screeched and i thought i saw one of the kids turn around .
he crawled up to her ear and whispered something that i couldnt hear .
she froze , but i saw her place her hands on his wrinkled skin .
fire flared from her fingertips , scorching his skin .
he let out a screech and vaulted off her , running as fast as his legs could take him .
i held an arrow out and emily set it ablaze .
i drew back , launching the arrow , and watching it as it hit the dwarf in the back .
the fire charred its dying body and i looked away to face my new attacker .
one jumped on my head and i swung with my knife .
it yelled into my ear , the one will rise , the one will rise !
he will destroy you !
i stabbed at him again , who ?
youre being too vague !
he jumped off me and ran into the woods .
he disappeared before i could notch an arrow and shoot him .
soon we were alone again .
emily made us all meet by the fountain .
i guess we all heard some weird dwarf talk .
okay ill start this time .
he said , kill all the dwarfs you like , but kojas will rise .
at least we have an idea of who they might be talking about .
she added to her list ; toad dwarf said , kill all you like but kojas will rise .
is kojas the person theyve been talking about ?
who is he ?
he told me , the one will rise , the one rise !
he will destroy you !
thats almost the same thing as last time .
i tapped the fountain .
she scribbled , toad dwarf said , the one will rise , the one will rise !
he will destroy you !
is kojas rising ?
seth , do you have anything ?
emily clicked her pencil .
seth shook his head , but jason spoke up , he said , the king will rise .
then he left .
emily added one last bullet ; toad dwarf said to jason , the king will rise .
her list was : toad dwarf said to jazell , hes rising , hes rising .
whos coming and is he important ?
toad dwarf told seth , you wont stop him , little warrior .
does this mean hes powerful ?
toad dwarf said to jason , he will destroy all half-ling .
what does half-ling mean ?
toad dwarf said to emily , kill all you like but kojas will rise .
is kojas the person theyve been talking about ?
who is he ?
toad dwarf said to jazell , the one will rise , the one will rise !
he will destroy you !
is kojas rising ?
toad dwarf said to jason , the king will rise .
she placed her notes in the middle so we could read it .
what does this all mean ?
i asked her .
she was silent , i guess the person theyre talking about is kojas , but we dont know who he is , or if hes important .
well , im thinking hes important because these weird dwarfs keep talking about him .
maybe hes their idol or something .
i said .
well , seth stated , maybe we should ask the dwarfs where he is .
thatll be hard .
emily pointed out .
they hardly tell us anything as it is .
you try squeezing out information from one of these pests .
i did .
whatever guys , were getting nowhere .
hey emily you want to sleep over tonight ?
i asked .
emily frowned , its my turn , jazell , and youre coming over my house .
honestly , em , just come over no , she said and crossed her arms stubbornly .
i sighed and ran a hand through my hair , knowing it was useless to argue with her when her mind was made up .
fine , ill call my parents .
but next time youre coming to my house .
she nodded , her curls bobbing .
fair enough .
okay then , see you two later .
jason turned around with seth on his heels .
wait a minute you two .
its only , i popped open my phone , 3pm .
we still have the rest of the day .
i shoved the phone back in my pocket .
hey , dont take this personally , but we want to hang out alone .
sobye !
jason said and jumped on his bike .
seth unchained his bike and rode off with him .
i realized then that seth had barely said anything the whole time , but he was already out of sight .
id have to question him later .
i sighed , well , at least we can hang out early .
well , while you were arguing with the boys i called home and they said you could come over now .
emily flashed me one of her million-watt smiles .
great !
i piped .
ill call home quickly to check with my parents .
i called home and my parents said i could go , which wasnt much of a surprise .
ive been to plenty of sleepovers at emilys , so my parents didnt mind .
plus , our parents were close and emilys family was practically an extension of our own .
we rode over to her house and parked our bikes in the garage .
we knocked on the door and a woman answered .
emilys mom was short , small and bony .
her light brown hair was almost blonde without any gray in it .
the woman definitely did not look her age at all , and she was still as beautiful as i imagined she was in her youth .
she smiled warmly at us , her smile a reflection of emilys .
hello girls , come in .
emily , dear , can you put your laundry away ?
after you do that , you can hang out in your room .
emily nodded and disappeared inside .
her mom moved aside so i could walk in .
i unlaced my sneakers and walked up the stairs , looking at the flower paintings hung along the wall that her mom had painted in her spare time .
i pushed open emilys bedroom door to see her stuffing her clothes in the drawer and flopping onto the bed .
she pulled out my bag and threw it to me so i could set up my sleeping bag on her rug .
her mom called us downstairs , hopefully for food .
she held a box of pizza .
you two can eat upstairs or down here .
she already knew our answer and handed us paper plates .
i took three slices of pizza and ran upstairs .
emily and i sat on the floor , eating pizza and doodling nonsense in her notebook .
the time ticked by to one oclock in the morning .
we sat side by side on her bed near the window , and i played with the fridge on the edge of one of her pillows .
i looked down at emilys pajamas , which were covered in sun-tanning penguins .
typical emily .
nice pjs emily .
i chuckled .
she stuck her tongue out , what do you have against sun-tanning penguins ?
nothing !
i smiled to myself .
i shouldnt be talking ; i was wearing pajamas covered in little pigs .
emily leaned back to turn off her desk light .
it clicked off and i gazed outside one more time before turning around to go to bed .
night emily .
i yawned .
emily didnt reply because her face was pushed up against the window .
her body was ridged and she didnt move .
i crawled over to the window .
what is it , em ?
i whispered , a nervous feeling creeping into my stomach .
she backed away from the window so i could see .
i saw nothing at first but then i spotted movement .
the recognizable lines of toad dwarfs marched around the trees , and i could tell they were up to no good again .
they were really starting to get on my nerves .
looks like i wasnt sleeping after all .
chapter 3 sneaking out after hours isnt easy , especially at emilys house .
her parents arent sound sleepers .
if we werent really careful , theyd wake up and then wed have some answering to do .
and i dont think theyd understand our reason .
i followed emily down the stairs , in our pajamas , to the door .
we were careful not to make a sound but i listened closely to the sound of her dad snoring .
when the snore rang clearly through the house , i breathed a sigh of relief .
we threw on our sneakers and snuck out the door .
the summer night air was cool but a little sticky and clammy , making our bodies feel damp .
i followed emily down to the back of the garage , where we sat down and entered the monsters world .
i pushed my green hair back and hid behind a tree beside emily to watch the dwarfs .
there must have been more than ten of them gathered together .
they were parading around a blazing camp fire , mumbling and talking about things i couldnt hear over the flames .
some more emerged from the woods and joined them , their shadows dancing behind them .
then all of them suddenly broke out into an ominous song : he will rise to the heavens , from the very pits of hell .
to take control of our world , and the gift- less ones as well .
he will rule with a flaming torch , and save those who are worthy .
and for those who arent , well , you better watch out !
they all broke out in crazed laughs , which gave me the impression that each and every one of them was mad .
hell , i knew they were already mad .
they threw dirt at the fire and continued their wild laughs .
emily shuddered by me as they lifted their voices in another chorus .
he will rise to the heavens , from the very pits of hell , to crush all half-lings and to take their very souls .
for the king will rule all , with his cruelty and rage .
i wouldnt want to be that half-ling , that he spears through the head !
this time they were rolling on the floor , howling in laughter .
well , i didnt think this was very funny at all .
what was funny about getting speared through the head ?
i had a feeling the king they were talking about was kojas , and i really didnt want to be around to meet him , especially if it meant my head was going to become well acquainted with a weapon .
that is , if i was even a half-ling like the dwarfs claimed i was .
they laughed and sat in a tight circle mumbling things i didnt catch .
my hand slipped to my knife but emily grabbed my hand to keep me from drawing it from its leather case .
no jazell not yet , maybe we can learn a little more from them .
her voice was a hoarse whisper .
but emily , its awful to listen to .
cant we just destroy the camp ?
i went for my bow instead .
no , she said a little more clearly .
we have to wait and see what happens .
plus , we cant just randomly attack them .
i didnt really care .
the song was repeating itself in my head , like a taunt .
without thinking , i aimed and shot the nearest dwarf .
as soon as he went down , the whole camp was facing our direction .
i was standing up now where everyone could see me .
there was no point in hiding anymore .
emily stayed hidden behind the tree , and i could feel her glare trying to burn me into ashes .
youll wish you never shot one of his loyal servants .
a dwarf seemed to laugh at me .
kojas will destroy you , half-ling .
that is it , im sick of your riddles !
give me a darn straight answer or ill shoot every single one of you , i spat angrily , leveling my bow .
kill all you like half-ling , but that wont help you in the end .
you will pay heavily in a terrible death worth all the loyal lives youve slayed , the dwarf proclaimed , and his friends bellowed out an agreement .
i dont care what the heck you say about dying because nothing will stop me from killing all of you !
youre making no apparent sense at all , and i dont care what stupid message youre trying to send me !
i hissed so bad i think that i spit .
gross .
oh but you will care , half-ling .
the dwarf was now whispering and all the others had fallen silent so they could hear .
you will care because in the end , he will destroy you once hes done using you .
my arms were still tense and my muscles whined in protest as i held my arrow back in full draw .
use me to do what ?
i spoke , using the same tone as him .
the dwarfs eyes were twinkling in happiness .
he seemed happy to tell me the answer .
to take over the gift-less ones world , why else half-ling ?
youre the connection between igneeria and your world .
he needs you and he has made that clear .
the world had fallen to silence .
i spoke in barely a whisper , igneeria , thats your world isnt it ?
what does kojas want ?
the dwarf seemed to be getting extremely excited now , he wants your world and all other worlds because he is a mighty king who wishes to expand his kingdom .
so how would we help him do that ?
i asked , stalling .
we just exterminate the pests .
youre a half-ling !
youre the bridge to our world .
now if you dont mind we would like to finish you now , and bring you to the king .
the dwarf said politely and snickered , approaching me .
i backed up slowly .
uh , i mind a lot actually .
i said quickly but i guess they didnt really want my opinion .
emily jumped out from behind the trees and lifted a flame .
she twirled it around with the movement of her hands and shot it at the nearest dwarf .
that started what seemed like a war .
all the dwarfs scrambled towards us and i simply shot them and emily fried them .
then jason and seth dissolved from the shadows and entered the clearing .
what are you two doing here ?
i yelled across to them , annoyed that they hadnt made their presence known earlier .
seth fought his way over to me , why do you need to know ?
because you just randomly appeared and i would like to know what youre doing in emilys backyard in the middle of the night .
i pointed out and took down the last dwarf .
we gathered around the barely burning embers , after we had re-entered our own world .
emily and i quickly summed up what we had learned from the dwarfs .
jason listened and didnt speak , like usual , and for once seth didnt interrupt .
when we were finished nobody said a word as they soaked up everything that had happened .
it seemed like it was just too much for all of us to take in .
all of a sudden seth spoke up .
why are you wearing sun-tanning penguin pajamas , emily ?
emily glared at him , what do you have against penguins ?
and why cant i wear pajamas ?
its the middle of the night you know .
seth wasnt bothered by her glare .
so it wouldnt have been hard to change .
seth should have realized that he was pushing emilys limited patience too far and that he should shut up .
she reached down and grabbed a small stick .
then she smacked seth across the head with it .
live with it seth .
emily said every word apart and wacked him again .
seth made a small , ow .
every time she hit him .
he grimaced and said , stop hitting me already !
alright , she made a motion to put the stick down and hit him again in the head .
he glared at her and she threw it on the floor , now im done .
so jason , i faced him and he looked up at me , since seth wont tell me ill ask you .
how did you guys find us ?
we followed a dwarf that was running here .
if we didnt get lost , we would have been here faster , jasons face turned the color of his red igneerian hair .
its okay , at least you answered me , i shot seth a look .
well if its okay with you boys , we would like to get to bed .
its almost 1:30 in the morning , and i would like to get home before my dad wakes himself up , emily said , and walked towards her house .
i waved quickly and followed .
the rest of the night was quiet and didnt include singing dwarfs .
before we went to bed though there was a lot of furious writing as emily tried to write everything down .
after that , was all sleep .
in the morning , we ate pancakes that emilys mom had made us and set off for the park .
we happened to run into jason and seth half way and at the same time watched a pole freeze in the middle of july .
you dont get to see that every day , which usually meant there was a monster involved .
jason , seth and emily saw it too because i was chasing after them as we all ran for the few trees ahead .
in a few seconds i had a complete view of the culprit .
and strange enough it was a frost beast .
frost beasts are the cutest monsters youll ever see .
theyre the size of medium dogs and their pelts are a light , icy blue .
they may be cute but if you dont watch out , they could easily be the most dangerous monsters around .
dont let them breath on you , or youll freeze to death .
literally .
the frost beast whimpered at me , showing me the cutest eyes imaginable .
i wanted to melt and hug him but i knew better not to fall victim to its trick .
i drew a single arrow and aimed it at its throat .
i didnt want to kill it , but i knew if i didnt , it would kill me without a second thought .
frost beasts dont appear until the end of fall and into winter .
they love the cold and cant stand the heat .
thats why i knew something was wrong right away , because it shouldnt have been here .
it was against its nature and when nature goes wrong , thats a big sign .
i pulled back on the string but emily ran forward and shot fire .
the beast simply opened its mouth and breathed .
what was a shot of fire was now a single icicle that landed on the ground in front of it .
instead jason came forward and attacked with his knives .
the beast froze the first few into harmless ice cubes but finally went down when one got past its defenses .
behind his body appeared seven thrashers and many more frost beasts .
it was like a monster reunion .
ive never seen so many in one place before .
a thrasher pack had at least six or seven but there must have been more than ten monsters total .
it was scary .
right then , right at that very moment , i knew something was terribly wrong .
they all stopped in front of us , all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us .
they made me confused , from the warm feeling the frost beasts gave me to the cold feeling the thrashers inflicted .
they exchanged some sort of signal , including grunts and yips , and slowly advanced on us .
the dogs stalked toward the four of us looking like a animals about to attack their prey .
the cute look was gone and all that was left was hunger .
the dog nearest to me jumped at my chest and landed on my stomach .
i managed to push it down before it breathed on me .
my legs froze in place .
emily i need some defrost .
i called to her as the cold seeped through my pants and bit at my skin .
emily turned her head and was about to reply when the dog caught her robe .
she spun around , shooting fire and completely forgetting my cry for help .
at the same time my dog attacker pushed me to the ground , freeing my legs for me .
get off me mutt .
i growled at his face .
he stared down at me , debating whether or not to freeze me right away .
that was his mistake because while he was waiting , i had brought my hunting dagger down on him .
i stood up and shook the heavy body off .
i didnt even have time to breath before one of the thrashers decided that they would like to have a taste of me .
i decided that i didnt want to be shredded like some old rug , so i moved out of his path .
that was the worst mistake i made , without even realizing it .
at the same time another thrasher was heading in my direction , and by moving out of the way from the first one , i had placed myself in the path of the second one .
it slammed into my side at such a great force i tasted blood in my mouth , when i hit the ground .
then i felt pain , saw blood , and then nothing at all .
chapter 4 i heard muffled voices around me as i regained consciousness .
my head throbbed slightly , and so did my side and my tongue .
that explained why i had tasted blood ; i must have bitten it .
for a second i thought i had returned to my human self when i heard a blast of fire that probably came from emily .
seth when will she wake up ?
a voice said .
then i realized it was emily .
shes alive and shell wake up soon .
stop nagging me , a different voice said that was obviously seths .
he was really close to me because i could feel his breath on my face and his voice was very loud .
which wasnt helping my throbbing head at all .
but when ?
i dont like just staying here , when more monsters might come .
we cant do two things at once .
emily nagged anyway .
i could just picture her bouncing up and down on her heels , full of tension .
i felt rush of hot air near my left side .
seth was probably sighing , we cant move her emily .
if we could , we would .
i opened my eyes to see seth face hovering above me .
emily was pacing in the background and jason was standing off to the side , looking very uninterested in the current situation .
seth smiled at me and i felt myself blush .
it was kind of embarrassing to get knocked out when no one else did .
welcome back , zombie hunter girl , seth teased .
how long was i out ?
i asked , blushing brighter .
except i couldnt pin down the reason why .
seth frowned , i dont know but it seemed like forever .
you scared us , jazell .
especially seth , emily piped up behind him .
he was the one going crazy to bandage you and was worrying more than the rest of us .
seths face reached a new undiscovered level of red , i didnt want to lose a friend .
